"BY late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical excitement."
"Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected—so entirely novel—so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions—as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears."
"It appears that on the—— day of—— (I am not positive about the date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam."
"The day was warm—unusually so for the season—there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament."
"Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam."
The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident.
"From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed below."
What could it be?
"In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend?"
"No one knew, no one could imagine; no one—not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk—had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly—then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally—puffed again."
"In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke."
In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned.
It appeared to be—yes!
it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before.
"For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers?"
"No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose."
It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam.
"As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible."
Being little or nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down.
"And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin."
But still worse.
"Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle."
"It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself."
"Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever."
"To be sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Pfaall and his associates."
But to return.
"The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant."
This was in truth a very droll little somebody.
"He could not have been more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon."
"The body of the little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd."
"His feet, of course, could not be seen at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat."
His hands were enormously large.
"His hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind."
"His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head."
"This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees."
"His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions."
"Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma."
"Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant."
"He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book."
"This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight."
"He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk."
His Excellency stooped to take it up.
"But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam."
"It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity."
"It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death."
"In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam."
"All attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk."
"That functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy."
"It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communications."
"To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam."
"“Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable."
"If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself."
"It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my disappearance."
"My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind—they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows."
"For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve."
"Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will."
"But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing."
"People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all."
"They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age."
"If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer."
This was a state of things not to be endured.
"I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life."
"Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation."
"My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure."
"There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law."
"Upon these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss."
"I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me."
"“One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s stall."
"Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach."
"It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name."
"I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me."
"By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home."
"But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer."
There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner.
The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me.
"The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error."
"In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found."
Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas.
"In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone."
"I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina."
"This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations."
"But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued."
"“It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed."
"My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation."
"Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller’s stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy."
"Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan."
"In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance."
"In this I finally succeeded—partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their services."
By these means—for they were ignorant men—I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.
"“Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money."
"With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions."
"This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding."
"In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known."
"I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid."
The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself—or at least never applied to any similar purpose.
"The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself."
"The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility."
"I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good."
"I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention."
"“On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter."
"In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth."
"In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder."
"These—the keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask."
"I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation."
"“Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air."
"I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable."
"But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations."
My balloon was soon completed.
"It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain."
"It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive."
"“Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and bade her farewell."
Indeed I had no fear on her account.
"She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance."
"I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me."
"It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were deposited."
"We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business."
“It was the first of April.
"The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable."
"But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage."
"I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others."
"They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo."
"They could not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations."
"I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it should be."
"I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether."
"I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination."
"To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass."
“In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated.
"I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it—not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk."
I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat.
"It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure."
"Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks."
"This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more."
"“Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror."
"Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced."
"Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder."
"When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause—my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power."
"But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life."
"The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled."
It is impossible—utterly impossible—to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation.
I gasped convulsively for breath—a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame—I felt my eyes starting from their sockets—a horrible nausea overwhelmed me—and at length I fainted away.
“How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say.
"It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon."
"My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated."
"Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation."
"I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails."
"I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon."
"Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined."
"It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind."
"But, strange to say!"
I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken.
"If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt."
For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation.
"I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance."
"Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles."
"This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis."
"I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position."
"Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat."
"I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished."
"To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist."
"Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work."
"“My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular."
"So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril."
"It should be remembered, however, that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,—I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment."
"But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin."
"In fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it."
"But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration."
"In good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the car."
“It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon.
"I then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured."
"My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions."
"Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question."
"Looking at my watch, I found it six o’clock."
"I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles."
"Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino."
"Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W."
"Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen."
“It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object of my perilous voyage.
Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide.
"It was not, however, that to life itself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation."
"In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination."
I then finally made up my mind.
"I determined to depart, yet live—to leave the world, yet continue to exist—in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon."
"Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible."
“The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to.
"Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles."
I say the mean or average interval.
"But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon’s orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished."
"But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles."
"Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance."
"Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated."
"But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon."
"There were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter."
“The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance.
"From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe."
"It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s diameter—that is, not exceeding eighty miles—the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence."
"But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface."
"Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical."
"The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot."
"This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation."
"“But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing."
"It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found."
"It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction."
"“On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever."
"But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation."
"On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet’s ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease."
"Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit."
"For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force."
"In other words, the sun’s attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution."
"Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question."
But again.
"The real diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion."
"Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity?"
"The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention."
"This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun’s equator."
"It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther."
"(*2) Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet’s ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun."
"It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological."
"“Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation."
"Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration."
This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon.
"I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period."
This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel.
"“It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate."
"Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing—I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated."
"On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish."
"It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power."
"I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it—that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending—for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen."
"In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth’s attraction would be superseded by that of the moon."
"In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days."
"“There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude."
"It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained."
(*3) This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling.
"Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself?"
I finally thought not.
"Their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels—not in any positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart."
"Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration."
"In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish—and to endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution."
"“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage."
"I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind."
"“Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast."
"I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel."
"I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head."
"The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance."
"These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car."
"“At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction."
The prospect seemed unbounded.
"Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth’s area I beheld."
"The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere."
"Now, in my case, the versed sine—that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me—was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface."
"‘As five miles, then, to eight thousand,’ would express the proportion of the earth’s area seen by me."
"In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe."
"The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation."
"The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward."
"I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears—still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom."
The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.
"“At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin."
"This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation."
"I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds."
"Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent."
"In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal."
"This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day."
No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night.
Hell itself might have been found a fitting image.
"Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire."
I had indeed made a narrow escape.
"Had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud—that is to say—had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence."
"Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons."
"I had by this time, however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head."
"“I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half."
I began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath.
"My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears."
"My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness."
"Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision."
"These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm."
"At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast."
"The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself."
"I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner—bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes."
"The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison."
"I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my agitation was excessive."
"I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes."
The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life.
"I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase."
"Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me for the moment."
"I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties."
In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.
"Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife."
"The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely."
"I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour."
"At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension."
"The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser."
"In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens."
This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence.
"It would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension."
"I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface."
"Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea."
“By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth.
"Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did."
"The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected."
"I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest."
"I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use."
"“The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed."
"To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity."
"At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa."
"Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth."
"From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract."
"Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly visible."
"“The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving them their liberty."
"I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the wicker-work."
"He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car."
"I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon."
"He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries."
"He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and he fell dead within the car."
The other one did not prove so unfortunate.
"To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner."
"In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety."
"Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction."
"Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever."
"“At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser."
"This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration."
"With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag."
"In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed."
"That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached."
"Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work—in other words, between the net-work and the hoop."
"But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime?"
"Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses."
"I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder."
"Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops—not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened—but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops."
"This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons."
In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop.
"It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons."
"This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them."
"Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy."
"I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion."
"This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation."
"All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet."
"“In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction."
"In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself."
"This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith."
"This, of course, was a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it."
"“About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw."
"In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic."
"Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber."
"This operation being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration."
"But in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs."
It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car—the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below.
"To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner—the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected."
"For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary."
"I did this at some little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached."
"“By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o’clock."
"During the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance."
"But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention."
Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease—and indeed why should I not?
"I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me."
"A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had now to complain."
"Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration."
"“At twenty minutes before nine o’clock—that is to say, a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction."
"It then indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies."
"At nine o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro."
I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.
“At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve.
"They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity—being out of sight in a very few seconds."
"I did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration."
"But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation."
“By ten o’clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention.
"Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase."
"I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber."
"This latter point I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary."
In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations.
Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon.
"Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land."
"Now there were hoary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom."
"Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever."
"Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds."
"And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams."
"And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed."
"“This then,” I said thoughtfully, “is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on.” But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain."
"Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility."
"Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention."
"“At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve."
"The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely."
"I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure."
"But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever."
"I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately experienced."
"It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded."
"In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom."
"Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner."
"Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained."
"My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune."
"“At six o’clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth’s visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night."
"It was not, however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure."
"It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period."
"I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness."
"“At ten o’clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking."
"If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim?"
"To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue."
"The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent."
But this hesitation was only momentary.
"I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual."
It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose.
"It would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing."
"But this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution."
"To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness."
"My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time."
"I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself."
"“It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever."
This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt.
"My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior of the car."
"I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position."
"About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf—but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had."
"Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited."
"I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape."
"This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes."
"This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time."
"Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious."
"My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher."
"It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim."
"It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world."
"“It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention."
Nor in this matter was I disappointed.
"Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed."
"These regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o’clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon."
“April 3d.
"I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth’s apparent convexity increased in a material degree."
"Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands."
"Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea."
"My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself."
"I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish."
"Much, however, might be ascertained."
Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day.
"My apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation."
"The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat."
"When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation."
"The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical interruption."
“April 4th.
"Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea."
"It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye."
"The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say."
"I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion."
The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent.
Cold by no means so intense.
"Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books."
“April 5th.
Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness.
"In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward."
"It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean."
"I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity."
"Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain."
Weather moderate.
Nothing of any consequence happened during the day.
Went early to bed.
“April 6th.
"Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north."
"It was evident that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole."
During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice.
"Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth’s form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle."
"When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it."
“April 7th.
"Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself."
"It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas!"
"I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned."
"Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o’clock in the morning of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea."
"This elevation may appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth."
At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth’s major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon.
"Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination."
"Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting."
"Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend."
"In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply defined, whose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness."
"Farther than this, little could be ascertained."
"By twelve o’clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M."
"I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator."
“April 8th.
"Found a sensible diminution in the earth’s apparent diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance."
"The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye."
"My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself."
"This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent."
"Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics."
"This circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success."
"Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8’ 48”."
“April 9th.
"To-day the earth’s diameter was greatly diminished, and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow."
"The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf."
“April 10th.
"I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o’clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no manner account."
"It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience."
"It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon."
"I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order."
"Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it."
"Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great anxiety and agitation."
“April 11th.
"Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full."
It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.
“April 12th.
"A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most unequivocal delight."
"Having reached, in its former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar elipse."
"What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of route—a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours."
“April 13th.
"Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth."
"Thought long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion."
"Great decrease in the earth’s apparent diameter, which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees."
"The moon could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith."
"I still continued in the plane of the elipse, but made little progress to the eastward."
“April 14th.
Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth.
"To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee—in other words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth."
"The moon itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view."
Great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.
“April 15th.
Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness.
"About twelve o’clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before."
"It now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered intensity as it continued."
"At length, while, stupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon."
"When my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones for want of a better appellation."
“April 16th.
"To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very small portion of the moon’s disk protruding, as it were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon."
My agitation was extreme; for I had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage.
"Indeed, the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion."
Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question.
"I became quite ill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion."
It was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer.
"During the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension."
“April 17th.
This morning proved an epoch in my voyage.
"It will be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular breadth of twenty-five degrees."
"On the fourteenth this had greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes."
"What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular diameter!"
I was thunderstruck!
"No words can give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed."
My knees tottered beneath me—my teeth chattered—my hair started up on end.
"“The balloon, then, had actually burst!” These were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: “The balloon had positively burst!—I was falling—falling with the most impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity!"
"To judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be hurled into annihilation!” But at length reflection came to my relief."
I paused; I considered; and I began to doubt.
The matter was impossible.
I could not in any reason have so rapidly come down.
"Besides, although I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly conceived."
"This consideration served to calm the perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view."
"In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance, between the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth."
"The latter was indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the moon—the moon itself in all its glory—lay beneath me, and at my feet."
"“The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation."
"For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite—or, more precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon."
"To be sure I arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although expected, was not expected at the moment."
"The revolution itself must, of course, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no means clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion—that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my person or about my apparatus."
"“It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon."
"It lay beneath me like a chart—and although I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness."
"The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition."
"Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance."
The highest among them does not exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description I might think proper to attempt.
"The greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling."
“April 18th.
To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon’s apparent bulk—and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm.
"It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all."
"But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke’s comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal."
"He observed the moon when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset, before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it became visible."
"The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible."
"Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated."
"This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun’s rays by the moon’s atmosphere."
"I computed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet."
"My ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter’s satellites, the third disappeared after having been about 1” or 2” of time indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb."
(*4)
"“Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars, when approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular figure changed into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he found no alteration of figure at all."
"Hence it might be supposed, that at some times and not at others, there is a dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are refracted."
"“Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent."
"Should I then, after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite."
"And, indeed, I had now every reason to be terrified."
"My distance from the moon was comparatively trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air."
“April 19th.
"This morning, to my great joy, about nine o’clock, the surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere."
"By ten, I had reason to believe its density considerably increased."
"By eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o’clock, with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from around the car."
"As might have been expected, spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger."
"But these and other difficulties attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon."
"This approach, however, was still impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that, although I had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I had been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon."
"Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation."
"That it was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough; why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which I have formerly alluded."
"At all events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity."
"I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the car."
But it was all to no purpose.
"I still fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile from the surface."
"As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach, was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city, and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set a-kimbo."
"I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull, copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold."
"No traces of land or water could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted with tropical and equatorial zones."
"“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth."
But my adventures yet remain to be related.
"And indeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have intelligence for the private ear of the States’ College of Astronomers of far more importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded."
"This is, in fact, the case."
I have much—very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate.
"I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of a variable zone of running water, of the people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political institutions; of their peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the earth—a connection analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your Excellencies—above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon—regions which, owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite’s rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God’s mercy, never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man."
"All this, and more—much more—would I most willingly detail."
"But, to be brief, I must have my reward."
"I am pining for a return to my family and to my home, and as the price of any farther communication on my part—in consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science—I must solicit, through the influence of your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam."
"This, then, is the object of the present paper."
"Its bearer, an inhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your Excellencies’ pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if it can, in any manner, be obtained."
"“I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies’ very humble servant,"
“HANS PFAALL.”
"Upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document, Professor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration."
There was no doubt about the matter—the pardon should be obtained.
"So at least swore, with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother in science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted."
"Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster’s dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear—no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam—the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance."
"To the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore at an end."
"Not so, however, rumors and speculations."
"The letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion."
Some of the over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better than a hoax.
"But hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their comprehension."
"For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation."
Let us see what they say:
Imprimus.
That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.
Don’t understand at all.
Secondly.
"That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges."
Well—what of that?
Thirdly.
"That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been made in the moon."
"They were dirty papers—very dirty—and Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in Rotterdam."
He was mistaken—undoubtedly—mistaken.
"Fourthly, That Hans Pfaall himself, the drunken villain, and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea."
Don’t believe it—don’t believe a word of it.
Lastly.
"That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world,—not to mention colleges and astronomers in general,—are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be."
"MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand."
"He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want."
"To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island, near Charleston, South Carolina."
This Island is a very singular one.
"It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three miles long."
Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile.
"It is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen."
"The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish."
No trees of any magnitude are to be seen.
"Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England."
"The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with its fragrance."
"In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance."
This soon ripened into friendship—for there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem.
"I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy."
"He had with him many books, but rarely employed them."
"His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological specimens;—his collection of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm."
"In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young “Massa Will.” It is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer."
"The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary."
"About the middle of October, 18-, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness."
"Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks—my residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the Island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day."
"Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in."
A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.
"It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one."
"I threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts."
"Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome."
"Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens for supper."
Legrand was in one of his fits—how else shall I term them?—of enthusiasm.
"He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Jupiter’s assistance, a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow."
"“And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil."
"“Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Legrand, “but it’s so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others?"
"As I was coming home I met Lieutenant G—, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning."
"Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise."
It is the loveliest thing in creation!”
“What?—sunrise?”
“Nonsense!
no!—the bug.
"It is of a brilliant gold color—about the size of a large hickory-nut—with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other."
The antennæ are—”
"“Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,” here interrupted Jupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing—neber feel half so hebby a bug in my life.”"
"“Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason for your letting the birds burn?"
The color”—here he turned to me—“is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter’s idea.
You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit—but of this you cannot judge till tomorrow.
"In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.” Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper."
"He looked for some in a drawer, but found none."
"“Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen."
"While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly."
"When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising."
"As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door."
"Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits."
"When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted."
"“Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, “this is a strange scarabæus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it before—unless it was a skull, or a death’s-head—which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation.”"
"“A death’s-head!” echoed Legrand—“Oh—yes—well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt."
"The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh?"
and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth—and then the shape of the whole is oval.”
"“Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist."
"I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance.”"
"“Well, I don’t know,” said he, a little nettled, “I draw tolerably—should do it at least—have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”"
"“But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I, “this is a very passable skull—indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology—and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it."
"Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint."
"I presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis, or something of that kind—there are many similar titles in the Natural Histories."
But where are the antennæ you spoke of?”
"“The antennæ!” said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; “I am sure you must see the antennæ."
"I made them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient.”"
"“Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have—still I don’t see them;” and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me—and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennæ visible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head."
"He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention."
In an instant his face grew violently red—in another as excessively pale.
For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat.
"At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room."
Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions.
"He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment."
"Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked."
He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared.
Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted.
"As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him."
"It had been my intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave."
"He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality."
"It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man, Jupiter."
"I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend."
"“Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?—how is your master?”"
"“Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.”"
“Not well!
I am truly sorry to hear it.
What does he complain of?”
“Dar!
dat’s it!—him neber plain of notin—but him berry sick for all dat.”
"“Very sick, Jupiter!—why didn’t you say so at once?"
Is he confined to bed?”
"“No, dat he aint!—he aint find nowhar—dat’s just whar de shoe pinch—my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.”"
"“Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about."
You say your master is sick.
Hasn’t he told you what ails him?”
"“Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad about de matter—Massa Will say noffin at all aint de matter wid him—but den what make him go about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white as a gose?"
And den he keep a syphon all de time—”
"“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”"
“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate—de queerest figgurs I ebber did see.
"Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you."
Hab for to keep mighty tight eye pon him noovers.
Todder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day.
I had a big stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when he did come—but Ise sich a fool dat I hadn’t de heart arter all—he look so berry poorly.”
"“Eh?—what?—ah yes!—upon the whole I think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow—don’t flog him, Jupiter—he can’t very well stand it—but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct?"
Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?”
"“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin unpleasant since den—‘twas fore den I’m feared—‘twas de berry day you was dare.”"
“How?
what do you mean?”
"“Why, massa, I mean de bug—dare now.”"
“The what?”
"“De bug,—I’m berry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout de head by dat goole-bug.”"
"“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?”"
"“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth too."
I nebber did see sick a deuced bug—he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him.
"Massa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell you—den was de time he must ha got de bite."
"I did n’t like de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I would n’t take hold ob him wid my finger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found."
I rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff—dat was de way.”
"“And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle, and that the bite made him sick?”"
“I do n’t tink noffin about it—I nose it.
"What make him dream bout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug?"
Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs fore dis.”
“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”
“How I know?
why cause he talk about it in he sleep—dat’s how I nose.”
"“Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”"
"“What de matter, massa?”"
“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”
"“No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me a note which ran thus:"
    MY DEAR ——
Why have I not seen you for so long a time?
"I hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie of mine; but no, that is improbable."
Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety.
"I have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should tell it at all."
"I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you believe it?—he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, solus, among the hills on the main land."
I verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.
I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.
"If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter."
Do come.
"I wish to see you to-night, upon business of importance."
I assure you that it is of the highest importance.
"        Ever yours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND."
There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness.
Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.
What could he be dreaming of?
What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain?
What “business of the highest importance” could he possibly have to transact?
Jupiter’s account of him boded no good.
"I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend."
"Without a moment’s hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro."
"Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired."
"“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”"
“Very true; but what are they doing here?”
"“Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and de debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.”"
"“But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’ going to do with scythes and spades?”"
"“Dat’s more dan I know, and debbil take me if I don’t blieve ‘tis more dan he know, too."
But it’s all cum ob do bug.”
"Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped into the boat and made sail."
"With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut."
It was about three in the afternoon when we arrived.
Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation.
He grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained.
"His countenance was pale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre."
"After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from Lieutenant G ——."
"“Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the next morning."
Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus.
Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it?”
"“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart."
"“In supposing it to be a bug of real gold.” He said this with an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked."
"“This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a triumphant smile, “to reinstate me in my family possessions."
"Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it?"
"Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index."
Jupiter; bring me that scarabæus!”
“What!
"de bug, massa?"
"I’d rudder not go fer trubble dat bug—you mus git him for your own self.” Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed."
"It was a beautiful scarabæus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists—of course a great prize in a scientific point of view."
"There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other."
"The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold."
"The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand’s concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell."
"“I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed my examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug”—"
"“My dear Legrand,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly unwell, and had better use some little precautions."
"You shall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over this."
You are feverish and”—
"“Feel my pulse,” said he."
"I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of fever."
“But you may be ill and yet have no fever.
Allow me this once to prescribe for you.
"In the first place, go to bed."
In the next”—
"“You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect to be under the excitement which I suffer."
"If you really wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.”"
“And how is this to be done?”
“Very easily.
"Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide."
You are the only one we can trust.
"Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed.”"
"“I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills?”"
“It has.”
"“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.”"
“I am sorry—very sorry—for we shall have to try it by ourselves.”
“Try it by yourselves!
The man is surely mad!—but stay!—how long do you propose to be absent?”
“Probably all night.
"We shall start immediately, and be back, at all events, by sunrise.”"
"“And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!)"
"settled to your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of your physician?”"
"“Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.”"
With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend.
"We started about four o’clock—Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself."
"Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades—the whole of which he insisted upon carrying—more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance."
"His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey."
"For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the scarabæus, which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went."
"When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend’s aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears."
"I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success."
"In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition."
"Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than “we shall see!”"
"We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff; and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen."
"Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion."
"In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen."
"It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined."
"Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene."
"The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance."
"When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it."
"The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply."
"At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention."
"When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,"
"“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”"
"“Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about.”"
"“How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Jupiter."
"“Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to go—and here—stop!"
take this beetle with you.”
"“De bug, Massa Will!—de goole bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in dismay—“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?—d-n if I do!”"
"“If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string—but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.”"
"“What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; “always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger."
Was only funnin any how.
Me feered de bug!
"what I keer for de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree."
"In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem."
"Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality."
"Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished."
"The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground."
"“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?” he asked."
"“Keep up the largest branch—the one on this side,” said Legrand."
"The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it."
Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.
“How much fudder is got for go?”
“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.
"“Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob de tree.”"
"“Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say."
Look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side.
How many limbs have you passed?”
"“One, two, tree, four, fibe—I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis side.”"
“Then go one limb higher.”
"In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh limb was attained."
"“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evidently much excited, “I want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can."
"If you see anything strange, let me know.” By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally at rest."
"I had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about getting him home."
"While I was pondering upon what was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice was again heard."
“Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far—tis dead limb putty much all de way.”
"“Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering voice."
"“Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail—done up for sartain—done departed dis here life.”"
"“What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest distress."
"“Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, “why come home and go to bed."
Come now!—that’s a fine fellow.
"It’s getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.”"
"“Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”"
"“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”"
"“Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very rotten.”"
"“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few moments, “but not so berry rotten as mought be."
"Mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.”"
“By yourself!—what do you mean?”
“Why I mean de bug.
‘Tis berry hebby bug.
"Spose I drop him down fuss, and den de limb won’t break wid just de weight ob one nigger.”"
"“You infernal scoundrel!” cried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that?"
As sure as you drop that beetle I’ll break your neck.
"Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”"
"“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger dat style.”"
“Well!
"now listen!—if you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.”"
"“I’m gwine, Massa Will—deed I is,” replied the negro very promptly—“mos out to the eend now.”"
"“Out to the end!” here fairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are out to the end of that limb?”"
"“Soon be to de eend, massa,—o-o-o-o-oh!"
Lor-gol-a-marcy!
what is dis here pon de tree?”
"“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted, “what is it?”"
"“Why taint noffin but a skull—somebody bin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”"
"“A skull, you say!—very well!—how is it fastened to the limb?—what holds it on?”"
"“Sure nuff, massa; mus look."
"Why dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my word—dare’s a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.”"
"“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you—do you hear?”"
"“Yes, massa.”"
"“Pay attention, then!—find the left eye of the skull.”"
“Hum!
hoo!
dat’s good!
why dare aint no eye lef at all.”
“Curse your stupidity!
do you know your right hand from your left?”
"“Yes, I nose dat—nose all bout dat—tis my lef hand what I chops de wood wid.”"
“To be sure!
you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand.
"Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the skull, or the place where the left eye has been."
Have you found it?”
Here was a long pause.
"At length the negro asked,"
"“Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull, too?—cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all—nebber mind!"
I got de lef eye now—here de lef eye!
what mus do wid it?”
"“Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach—but be careful and not let go your hold of the string.”"
"“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole—look out for him dare below!”"
"During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter’s person could be seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood."
"The scarabæus hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet."
"Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree."
"Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape measure."
"Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet—Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe."
"At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described."
"Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible."
"To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend’s equanimity by a refusal."
"Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro’s disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master."
"I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus, or, perhaps, by Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining it to be “a bug of real gold.” A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions—especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas—and then I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech about the beetle’s being “the index of his fortune.” Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of necessity—to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained."
"The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts."
We dug very steadily for two hours.
"Little was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest in our proceedings."
"He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity;—or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand;—for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home."
"The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task."
"When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest."
"A general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end."
"Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced."
"We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet."
Still nothing appeared.
"The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor."
In the mean time I made no remark.
"Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools."
"This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home."
"We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar."
"The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees."
"“You scoundrel,” said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth—“you infernal black villain!—speak, I tell you!—answer me this instant, without prevarication!—which—which is your left eye?”"
"“Oh, my golly, Massa Will!"
"aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master’s attempt at a gouge."
“I thought so!—I knew it!
"hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master."
“Come!
"we must go back,” said the latter, “the game’s not up yet;” and he again led the way to the tulip-tree."
"“Jupiter,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here!"
"was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the limb?”"
"“De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any trouble.”"
"“Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?”—here Legrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes."
"“Twas dis eye, massa—de lef eye—jis as you tell me,” and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated."
“That will do—must try it again.”
"Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position."
"Taking, now, the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging."
"Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades."
"I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed."
"I had become most unaccountably interested—nay, even excited."
"Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand—some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed me."
"I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion."
"At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog."
"His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone."
"Upon Jupiter’s again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws."
"In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen."
"One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light."
"At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth."
"We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement."
"During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process—perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury."
"This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep."
"It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open trelliswork over the whole."
"On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron—six in all—by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons."
Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed.
We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight.
"Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts."
These we drew back—trembling and panting with anxiety.
"In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us."
"As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes."
I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.
"Amazement was, of course, predominant."
"Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words."
"Jupiter’s countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro’s visage to assume."
He seemed stupified—thunderstricken.
"Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath."
"At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy,"
“And dis all cum ob de goole-bug!
de putty goole bug!
"de poor little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style!"
"Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger?—answer me dat!”"
"It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure."
"It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before daylight."
"It was difficult to say what should be done, and much time was spent in deliberation—so confused were the ideas of all."
"We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole."
"The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return."
"We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o’clock in the morning."
"Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more immediately."
"We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises."
"A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East."
We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose.
"After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours’ duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure."
"The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents."
There had been nothing like order or arrangement.
Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously.
"Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed."
"In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars—estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period."
There was not a particle of silver.
"All was gold of antique date and of great variety—French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before."
"There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions."
There was no American money.
The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating.
"There were diamonds—some of them exceedingly large and fine—a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy;—three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal."
These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest.
"The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification."
"Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments;—nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings;—rich chains—thirty of these, if I remember;—eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes;—five gold censers of great value;—a prodigious golden punch bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect."
"The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one."
"Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion—but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth."
"We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure."
"When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it."
"“You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the scarabæus."
"You recollect also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death’s-head."
"When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact."
"Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me—for I am considered a good artist—and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”"
"“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I."
"“No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment."
"It was quite dirty, you remember."
"Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death’s-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle."
For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy.
I knew that my design was very different in detail from this—although there was a certain similarity in general outline.
"Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely."
"Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it."
"My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline—at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus, and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing."
I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time.
This is the usual effect of such coincidences.
"The mind struggles to establish a connexion—a sequence of cause and effect—and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis."
"But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence."
"I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabæus."
"I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot."
"Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it."
"Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night’s adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration."
"I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone."
"“When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair."
In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession.
"The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark."
"Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop."
"Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it."
"It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper."
"It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up."
"Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship’s long boat."
The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.
"“Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me."
"Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant G-."
"I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort."
"Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection."
"Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once—you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History."
"At the same time, without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket."
"“You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept."
"I looked in the drawer, and found none there."
"I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment."
I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.
“No doubt you will think me fanciful—but I had already established a kind of connexion.
I had put together two links of a great chain.
"There was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment—not a paper—with a skull depicted upon it."
"You will, of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’ I reply that the skull, or death’s-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate."
The flag of the death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.
"“I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper."
Parchment is durable—almost imperishable.
"Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper."
This reflection suggested some meaning—some relevancy—in the death’s-head.
"I did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment."
"Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong."
"It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum—for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved.”"
"“But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle."
"How then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull—since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus?”"
"“Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving."
"My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result."
"I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the scarabæus, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment."
"When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it."
"You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it."
Then it was not done by human agency.
And nevertheless it was done.
"“At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question."
The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy accident!
"), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth."
I was heated with exercise and sat near the table.
"You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney."
"Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders."
"With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire."
"At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination."
"When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, upon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it."
"You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire."
"Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results."
"The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red."
"These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat."
“I now scrutinized the death’s-head with care.
Its outer edges—the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum—were far more distinct than the others.
It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal.
"I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat."
"At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death’s-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat."
"A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid.”"
“Ha!
"ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you—a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth—but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain—you will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goat—pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”"
“But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.”
"“Well, a kid then—pretty much the same thing.”"
"“Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Legrand."
“You may have heard of one Captain Kidd.
I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature.
I say signature; because its position upon the vellum suggested this idea.
"The death’s-head at the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal."
But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else—of the body to my imagined instrument—of the text for my context.”
“I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature.”
“Something of that kind.
"The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending."
I can scarcely say why.
"Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief;—but do you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect upon my fancy?"
And then the series of accidents and coincidences—these were so very extraordinary.
"Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the death’s-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?”"
“But proceed—I am all impatience.”
"“Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current—the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates."
These rumors must have had some foundation in fact.
"And that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed."
"Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form."
"You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about money-finders."
"Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped."
"It seemed to me that some accident—say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality—had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so common."
Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast?”
“Never.”
"“But that Kidd’s accumulations were immense, is well known."
"I took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved a lost record of the place of deposit.”"
“But how did you proceed?”
"“I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but nothing appeared."
"I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal."
"In a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines."
"Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain another minute."
"Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you see it now.” Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to my inspection."
"The following characters were rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death’s-head and the goat:"
"“But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark as ever."
"Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my solution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.”"
"“And yet,” said Legrand, “the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters."
"These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a cipher—that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs."
"I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple species—such, however, as would appear, to the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.”"
“And you really solved it?”
“Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater.
"Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve."
"In fact, having once established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import."
"“In the present case—indeed in all cases of secret writing—the first question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom."
"In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained."
"But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty was removed by the signature."
The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is appreciable in no other language than the English.
"But for this consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main."
"As it was, I assumed the cryptograph to be English."
“You observe there are no divisions between the words.
"Had there been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy."
"In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured."
"But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters, as well as the least frequent."
"Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:"
Of the character 8 there are 33.
"“We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution."
"I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development."
But be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph.
"It now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment, as unriddled."
Here it is:
“‘A good glass in the bishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”
"“But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever."
"How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about ‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s heads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”"
"“I confess,” replied Legrand, “that the matter still wears a serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance."
My first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist.”
"“You mean, to punctuate it?”"
“Something of that kind.”
“But how was it possible to effect this?”
"“I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution."
"Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object would be nearly certain to overdo the matter."
"When, in the course of his composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this place, more than usually close together."
"If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding."
"Acting upon this hint, I made the division thus: ‘A good glass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s seat—forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes—northeast and by north—main branch seventh limb east side—shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head—a bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”"
"“Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”"
"“It left me also in the dark,” replied Legrand, “for a few days; during which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s Island, for any building which went by the name of the ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ might have some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the Island."
"I accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place."
"At length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock."
"“I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she consented to accompany me to the spot."
"We found it without much difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place."
"The ‘castle’ consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks—one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance I clambered to its apex, and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done."
"“While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which I stood."
"This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors."
"I made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s seat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle."
"“The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen."
"Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it."
"Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, “forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,’ and ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass."
"Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the rock."
"“I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position."
This fact confirmed my preconceived idea.
I proceeded to use the glass.
"Of course, the ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, ‘northeast and by north.’ This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance."
"In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was."
"Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull."
"“Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’ could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree, while ‘shoot from the left eye of the death’s head’ admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure."
"I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through ‘the shot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point—and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed.”"
"“All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still simple and explicit."
"When you left the Bishop’s Hotel, what then?”"
"“Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned homewards."
"The instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’ however, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would."
"What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock."
"“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’ I had been attended by Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me alone."
"But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree."
After much toil I found it.
When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging.
With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself.”
"“I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt at digging, through Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull.”"
“Precisely.
"This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the ‘shot’—that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest the tree; and had the treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the error would have been of little moment; but ‘the shot,’ together with the nearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent."
"But for my deep-seated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.”"
"“But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle—how excessively odd!"
I was sure you were mad.
"And why did you insist upon letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?”"
"“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification."
"For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall it from the tree."
An observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.”
"“Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me."
What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”
“That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.
"There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them—and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply."
"It is clear that Kidd—if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt not—it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor."
"But this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret."
"Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen—who shall tell?”"
ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES is very generally looked upon as the Gog of the prophet Ezekiel.
"This honor is, however, more properly attributable to Cambyses, the son of Cyrus."
"And, indeed, the character of the Syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious embellishment."
"His accession to the throne, or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty, a hundred and seventy-one years before the coming of Christ; his attempt to plunder the temple of Diana at Ephesus; his implacable hostility to the Jews; his pollution of the Holy of Holies; and his miserable death at Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven years, are circumstances of a prominent kind, and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious, dastardly, cruel, silly, and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and reputation."
"Let us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a few minutes, imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man, the remarkable city of Antioch."
"To be sure there were, in Syria and other countries, sixteen cities of that appellation, besides the one to which I more particularly allude."
"But ours is that which went by the name of Antiochia Epidaphne, from its vicinity to the little village of Daphne, where stood a temple to that divinity."
"It was built (although about this matter there is some dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the country after Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus, and became immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy."
"In the flourishing times of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the eastern provinces; and many of the emperors of the queen city (among whom may be mentioned, especially, Verus and Valens) spent here the greater part of their time."
But I perceive we have arrived at the city itself.
"Let us ascend this battlement, and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring country."
"“What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with innumerable falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and finally through the wilderness of buildings?”"
"That is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the exception of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad mirror, about twelve miles off to the southward."
"Every one has seen the Mediterranean; but let me tell you, there are few who have had a peep at Antioch."
"By few, I mean, few who, like you and me, have had, at the same time, the advantages of a modern education."
"Therefore cease to regard that sea, and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us."
You will remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty.
"Were it later—for example, were it the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be deprived of this extraordinary spectacle."
"In the nineteenth century Antioch is—that is to say, Antioch will be—in a lamentable state of decay."
"It will have been, by that time, totally destroyed, at three different periods, by three successive earthquakes."
"Indeed, to say the truth, what little of its former self may then remain, will be found in so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to Damascus."
This is well.
"I see you profit by my advice, and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premises—in"
-satisfying your eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That most renown this city.—
I beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come.
But does not the appearance of Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?
“It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature as to art.”
Very true.
“There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.”
There are.
"“And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear comparison with the most lauded of antiquity.”"
All this I must acknowledge.
"Still there is an infinity of mud huts, and abominable hovels."
"We cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in every kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering fumes of idolatrous incense, I have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench."
"Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall?"
What gloom their shadows cast upon the ground!
It is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day; we should otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in the time of her desolation.
“It is certainly a strange place!
What is the meaning of yonder singular building?
See!
"it towers above all others, and lies to the eastward of what I take to be the royal palace.”"
"That is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under the title of Elah Gabalah."
"Hereafter a very notorious Roman Emperor will institute this worship in Rome, and thence derive a cognomen, Heliogabalus."
I dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the temple.
You need not look up at the heavens; his Sunship is not there—at least not the Sunship adored by the Syrians.
That deity will be found in the interior of yonder building.
"He is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid, whereby is denoted Fire."
"“Hark—behold!—who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked, with their faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the rabble?”"
Some few are mountebanks.
Others more particularly belong to the race of philosophers.
"The greatest portion, however—those especially who belabor the populace with clubs—are the principal courtiers of the palace, executing as in duty bound, some laudable comicality of the king’s."
“But what have we here?
Heavens!
the town is swarming with wild beasts!
How terrible a spectacle!—how dangerous a peculiarity!”
"Terrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous."
"Each animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very quietly, in the wake of its master."
"Some few, to be sure, are led with a rope about the neck, but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species."
"The lion, the tiger, and the leopard are entirely without restraint."
"They have been trained without difficulty to their present profession, and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of valets-de-chambre."
"It is true, there are occasions when Nature asserts her violated dominions;—but then the devouring of a man-at-arms, or the throttling of a consecrated bull, is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in Epidaphne."
“But what extraordinary tumult do I hear?
Surely this is a loud noise even for Antioch!
It argues some commotion of unusual interest.”
Yes—undoubtedly.
"The king has ordered some novel spectacle—some gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome—or perhaps the massacre of the Scythian prisoners—or the conflagration of his new palace—or the tearing down of a handsome temple—or, indeed, a bonfire of a few Jews."
The uproar increases.
Shouts of laughter ascend the skies.
"The air becomes dissonant with wind instruments, and horrible with clamor of a million throats."
"Let us descend, for the love of fun, and see what is going on!"
This way—be careful!
"Here we are in the principal street, which is called the street of Timarchus."
"The sea of people is coming this way, and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide."
"They are pouring through the alley of Heraclides, which leads directly from the palace;—therefore the king is most probably among the rioters."
Yes;—I hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the East.
We shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of Ashimah.
Let us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary; he will be here anon.
In the meantime let us survey this image.
What is it?
Oh!
it is the god Ashimah in proper person.
"You perceive, however, that he is neither a lamb, nor a goat, nor a satyr, neither has he much resemblance to the Pan of the Arcadians."
"Yet all these appearances have been given—I beg pardon—will be given—by the learned of future ages, to the Ashimah of the Syrians."
"Put on your spectacles, and tell me what it is."
What is it?
“Bless me!
it is an ape!”
True—a baboon; but by no means the less a deity.
His name is a derivation of the Greek Simia—what great fools are antiquarians!
But see!—see!—yonder scampers a ragged little urchin.
Where is he going?
What is he bawling about?
What does he say?
Oh!
"he says the king is coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that he has just finished putting to death, with his own hand, a thousand chained Israelitish prisoners!"
For this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies.
Hark!
here comes a troop of a similar description.
"They have made a Latin hymn upon the valor of the king, and are singing it as they go:"
"Mille, mille, mille,"
"Mille, mille, mille,"
"Decollavimus, unus homo!"
"Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!"
"Mille, mille, mille,"
Vivat qui mille mille occidit!
Tantum vini habet nemo
Quantum sanguinis effudit!
(*1)
Which may be thus paraphrased:
"A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,"
"A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,"
"We, with one warrior, have slain!"
"A thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand."
Sing a thousand over again!
Soho!—let us sing
"Long life to our king,"
Who knocked over a thousand so fine!
"Soho!—let us roar,"
He has given us more
Red gallons of gore
Than all Syria can furnish of wine!
“Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?”
Yes: the king is coming!
See!
"the people are aghast with admiration, and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence."
He comes;—he is coming;—there he is!
“Who?—where?—the king?—do not behold him—cannot say that I perceive him.”
Then you must be blind.
“Very possible.
"Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic cameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal’s hoofs."
See!
the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over—and another—and another—and another.
"Indeed, I cannot help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet.”"
"Rabble, indeed!—why these are the noble and free citizens of Epidaphne!"
"Beasts, did you say?—take care that you are not overheard."
Do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man?
"Why, my dear sir, that cameleopard is no other than Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus the Illustrious, King of Syria, and the most potent of all the autocrats of the East!"
"It is true, that he is entitled, at times, Antiochus Epimanes—Antiochus the madman—but that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits."
"It is also certain that he is at present ensconced in the hide of a beast, and is doing his best to play the part of a cameleopard; but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity as king."
"Besides, the monarch is of gigantic stature, and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large."
"We may, however, presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state."
"Such, you will allow, is the massacre of a thousand Jews."
With how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours!
"His tail, you perceive, is held aloft by his two principal concubines, Elline and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be infinitely prepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his eyes, which will certainly start out of his head, and the queer color of his face, which has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed."
"Let us follow him to the hippodrome, whither he is proceeding, and listen to the song of triumph which he is commencing:"
Who is king but Epiphanes?
Say—do you know?
Who is king but Epiphanes?
Bravo!—bravo!
"There is none but Epiphanes,"
No—there is none:
"So tear down the temples,"
And put out the sun!
Well and strenuously sung!
"The populace are hailing him ‘Prince of Poets,’ as well as ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards.’ They have encored his effusion, and do you hear?—he is singing it over again."
"When he arrives at the hippodrome, he will be crowned with the poetic wreath, in anticipation of his victory at the approaching Olympics."
"“But, good Jupiter!"
what is the matter in the crowd behind us?”
"Behind us, did you say?—oh!"
ah!—I perceive.
"My friend, it is well that you spoke in time."
Let us get into a place of safety as soon as possible.
"Here!—let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this aqueduct, and I will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion."
It has turned out as I have been anticipating.
"The singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man, has, it seems, given offence to the notions of propriety entertained, in general, by the wild animals domesticated in the city."
"A mutiny has been the result; and, as is usual upon such occasions, all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the mob."
Several of the Syrians have already been devoured; but the general voice of the four-footed patriots seems to be for eating up the cameleopard.
"‘The Prince of Poets,’ therefore, is upon his hinder legs, running for his life."
"His courtiers have left him in the lurch, and his concubines have followed so excellent an example."
"‘Delight of the Universe,’ thou art in a sad predicament!"
"‘Glory of the East,’ thou art in danger of mastication!"
"Therefore never regard so piteously thy tail; it will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this there is no help."
"Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable degradation; but take courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud for the hippodrome!"
Remember that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes.
"Antiochus the Illustrious!—also ‘Prince of Poets,’ ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards!’ Heavens!"
what a power of speed thou art displaying!
What a capacity for leg-bail thou art developing!
"Run, Prince!—Bravo, Epiphanes!"
"Well done, Cameleopard!—Glorious Antiochus!—He runs!—he leaps!—he flies!"
Like an arrow from a catapult he approaches the hippodrome!
He leaps!—he shrieks!—he is there!
"This is well; for hadst thou, ‘Glory of the East,’ been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the Amphitheatre, there is not a bear’s cub in Epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at thy carcase."
Let us be off—let us take our departure!—for we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king’s escape!
Listen!
it has already commenced.
See!—the whole town is topsy-turvy.
“Surely this is the most populous city of the East!
What a wilderness of people!
what a jumble of all ranks and ages!
what a multiplicity of sects and nations!
what a variety of costumes!
what a Babel of languages!
what a screaming of beasts!
what a tinkling of instruments!
what a parcel of philosophers!”
Come let us be off.
“Stay a moment!
"I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is the meaning of it, I beseech you?”"
"That?—oh, nothing!"
"The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne being, as they declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor, wisdom, and divinity of their king, and having, moreover, been eye-witnesses of his late superhuman agility, do think it no more than their duty to invest his brows (in addition to the poetic crown) with the wreath of victory in the footrace—a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next Olympiad, and which, therefore, they now give him in advance."
"The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis."
We appreciate them only in their effects.
"We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment."
"As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles."
He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play.
"He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural."
"His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition."
"The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis."
Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse.
"A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other."
"It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood."
"I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess."
"In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound."
The attention is here called powerfully into play.
"If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat."
"The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers."
"In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen."
"To be less abstract—Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected."
"It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect."
"Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation."
"Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous."
Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis.
The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind.
"When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived."
"These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding."
"To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible."
"Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing."
But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced.
"He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences."
"So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation."
The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe.
"Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game."
"He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents."
"He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each."
"He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin."
From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit.
"He recognises what is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table."
"A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation—all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs."
"The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own."
"The analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis."
"The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals."
"Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous."
"It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic."
The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.
"Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18—, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin."
"This young gentleman was of an excellent—indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes."
"By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities."
"Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained."
"Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion."
We saw each other again and again.
I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme.
"I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination."
"Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him."
"It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain."
"Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen—although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature."
Our seclusion was perfect.
We admitted no visitors.
Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in Paris.
We existed within ourselves alone.
It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?)
"to be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon."
The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence.
"At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays."
"By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness."
"Then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford."
At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin.
"He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise—if not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived."
"He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own."
"His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation."
"Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the creative and the resolvent."
"Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance."
"What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence."
But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.
We were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the Palais Royal.
"Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least."
All at once Dupin broke forth with these words:
"“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the Théâtre des Variétés.”"
"“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations."
"In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound."
"“Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension."
"I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses."
"How was it possible you should know I was thinking of ——-?” Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought."
"—“of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause?"
You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”
This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.
"Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the rôle of Xerxes, in Crébillon’s tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains."
"“Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if method there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express."
"“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.”"
“The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”
“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been fifteen minutes ago.”
"I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C —— into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand."
There was not a particle of charlatanerie about Dupin.
"“I will explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question."
"The larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”"
"There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained."
The occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.
"What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth."
He continued:
"“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C ——."
This was the last subject we discussed.
"As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair."
"You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence."
"I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity."
"“You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks."
"Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement."
"I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so."
You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps.
"But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday’s ‘Musée,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed."
I mean the line
"“I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it."
"It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly."
That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips.
You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation.
"So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height."
I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly.
"At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow—that Chantilly—he would do better at the Théâtre des Variétés.”"
"Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the “Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our attention."
"“EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS.—This morning, about three o’clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye."
"After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two gendarmes."
"By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house."
"As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet."
The party spread themselves and hurried from room to room.
"Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment."
“The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions.
"There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor."
"On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood."
"On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots."
"Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of métal d’Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold."
"The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them."
A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead).
"It was open, with the key still in the door."
"It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence."
"“Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!)"
"the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance."
The body was quite warm.
"Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged."
"Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death."
"“After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off."
"The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated—the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity."
"“To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew.”"
The next day’s paper had these additional particulars.
“The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue.
Many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair.
"[The word ‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us,] “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it."
We give below all the material testimony elicited.
"“Pauline Dubourg, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period."
The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms—very affectionate towards each other.
They were excellent pay.
Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living.
Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living.
Was reputed to have money put by.
Never met any persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home.
Was sure that they had no servant in employ.
There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story.
"“Pierre Moreau, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for nearly four years."
"Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there."
"The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than six years."
"It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons."
"The house was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion."
The old lady was childish.
Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years.
The two lived an exceedingly retired life—were reputed to have money.
Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not believe it.
"Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times."
"“Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect."
No one was spoken of as frequenting the house.
It was not known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter.
The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened.
"Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story."
The house was a good house—not very old.
"“Isidore Muset, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance."
"Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet—not with a crowbar."
"Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom not top."
The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced—and then suddenly ceased.
"They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony—were loud and drawn out, not short and quick."
Witness led the way up stairs.
"Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller—a very strange voice."
"Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman."
Was positive that it was not a woman’s voice.
Could distinguish the words ‘sacré’ and ‘diable.’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.
Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman.
"Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish."
The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday.
"“Henri Duval, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house."
Corroborates the testimony of Muset in general.
"As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour."
"The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian."
Was certain it was not French.
Could not be sure that it was a man’s voice.
It might have been a woman’s.
Was not acquainted with the Italian language.
"Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian."
Knew Madame L. and her daughter.
Had conversed with both frequently.
Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.
"“—Odenheimer, restaurateur."
This witness volunteered his testimony.
"Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter."
Is a native of Amsterdam.
Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks.
They lasted for several minutes—probably ten.
They were long and loud—very awful and distressing.
Was one of those who entered the building.
Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one.
Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man—of a Frenchman.
Could not distinguish the words uttered.
They were loud and quick—unequal—spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger.
The voice was harsh—not so much shrill as harsh.
Could not call it a shrill voice.
"The gruff voice said repeatedly ‘sacré,’ ‘diable,’ and once ‘mon Dieu.’"
"“Jules Mignaud, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine."
Is the elder Mignaud.
Madame L’Espanaye had some property.
Had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year—(eight years previously).
Made frequent deposits in small sums.
"Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs."
"This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home with the money."
"“Adolphe Le Bon, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags."
"Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other."
He then bowed and departed.
Did not see any person in the street at the time.
It is a bye-street—very lonely.
"“William Bird, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house."
Is an Englishman.
Has lived in Paris two years.
Was one of the first to ascend the stairs.
Heard the voices in contention.
The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.
"Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all."
Heard distinctly ‘sacré’ and ‘mon Dieu.’ There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling—a scraping and scuffling sound.
The shrill voice was very loud—louder than the gruff one.
Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman.
Appeared to be that of a German.
Might have been a woman’s voice.
Does not understand German.
"“Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it."
Every thing was perfectly silent—no groans or noises of any kind.
Upon forcing the door no person was seen.
"The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from within."
"A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked."
"The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with the key on the inside."
"A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage was open, the door being ajar."
"This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth."
These were carefully removed and searched.
There was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched.
Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys.
"The house was a four story one, with garrets (mansardes.)"
A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely—did not appear to have been opened for years.
"The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses."
Some made it as short as three minutes—some as long as five.
The door was opened with difficulty.
"“Alfonzo Garcio, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue."
Is a native of Spain.
Was one of the party who entered the house.
Did not proceed up stairs.
"Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation."
Heard the voices in contention.
The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.
Could not distinguish what was said.
The shrill voice was that of an Englishman—is sure of this.
"Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation."
"“Alberto Montani, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs."
Heard the voices in question.
The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.
Distinguished several words.
The speaker appeared to be expostulating.
Could not make out the words of the shrill voice.
Spoke quick and unevenly.
Thinks it the voice of a Russian.
Corroborates the general testimony.
Is an Italian.
Never conversed with a native of Russia.
"“Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being."
"By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys."
These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house.
There is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs.
The body of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.
"“Paul Dumas, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about day-break."
They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found.
The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated.
The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances.
The throat was greatly chafed.
"There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers."
"The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded."
The tongue had been partially bitten through.
"A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee."
"In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown."
The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated.
All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered.
"The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side."
Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored.
It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted.
"A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron—a chair—any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man."
No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon.
"The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered."
The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument—probably with a razor.
"“Alexandre Etienne, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the bodies."
"Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas."
"“Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined."
"A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris—if indeed a murder has been committed at all."
The police are entirely at fault—an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature.
"There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent.”"
"The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch—that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose."
"A postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned—although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed."
"Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair—at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments."
"It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders."
I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery.
I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer.
"“We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an examination."
"The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more."
"There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment."
"They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain’s calling for his robe-de-chambre—pour mieux entendre la musique."
"The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity."
"When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail."
"Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser and a persevering man."
"But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations."
He impaired his vision by holding the object too close.
"He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole."
Thus there is such a thing as being too profound.
Truth is not always in a well.
"In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial."
"The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found."
The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.
"To look at a star by glances—to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it."
"A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension."
"By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct."
"“As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them."
"An inquiry will afford us amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing] “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful."
We will go and see the premises with our own eyes.
"I know G——, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission.”"
"The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue."
This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch.
It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided.
"The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way."
"It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge."
"Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building—Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object."
"Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge."
"We went up stairs—into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay."
"The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist."
I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.” Dupin scrutinized every thing—not excepting the bodies of the victims.
"We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout."
"The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure."
On our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.
"I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les ménageais:—for this phrase there is no English equivalent."
"It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day."
"He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity."
"There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,” which caused me to shudder, without knowing why."
"“No, nothing peculiar,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper.”"
"“The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing."
But dismiss the idle opinions of this print.
"It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution—I mean for the outré character of its features."
The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive—not for the murder itself—but for the atrocity of the murder.
"They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending."
"The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents."
They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse.
"But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true."
"In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred before.’ In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.”"
I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.
"“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment—“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration."
"Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent."
I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle.
I look for the man here—in this room—every moment.
It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.
"Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him."
Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.”
"I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy."
I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times.
"His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance."
"His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall."
"“That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence."
This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide.
I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L’Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction.
"Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention."
Let me now advert—not to the whole testimony respecting these voices—but to what was peculiar in that testimony.
Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?”
"I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice."
"“That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence."
You have observed nothing distinctive.
Yet there was something to be observed.
"The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous."
"But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner."
Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen.
Each likens it—not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant—but the converse.
"The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.’ The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that ‘not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.’ The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and ‘does not understand German.’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that of an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘as he has no knowledge of the English.’ The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but ‘has never conversed with a native of Russia.’ A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited!—in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar!"
You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic—of an African.
"Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points."
The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh rather than shrill.’ It is represented by two others to have been ‘quick and unequal.’ No words—no sounds resembling words—were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable.
"“I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony—the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices—are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery."
I said ‘legitimate deductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully expressed.
"I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result."
"What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet."
"I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form—a certain tendency—to my inquiries in the chamber."
"“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber."
What shall we first seek here?
The means of egress employed by the murderers.
It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events.
Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits.
"The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially."
Then how?
"Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision.—Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress."
"It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs."
It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues.
"The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction."
No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance.
"But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own."
"There were, then, no secret issues."
"Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside."
Let us turn to the chimneys.
"These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat."
"The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows."
Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.
"The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room."
"Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities."
"It is only left for us to prove that these apparent ‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such."
“There are two windows in the chamber.
"One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible."
The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it.
The former was found securely fastened from within.
It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it.
"A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head."
"Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also."
The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions.
"And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows."
"“My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given—because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality."
“I proceeded to think thus—a posteriori.
The murderers did escape from one of these windows.
"This being so, they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened;—the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter."
Yet the sashes were fastened.
"They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves."
There was no escape from this conclusion.
"I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash."
"It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated."
"A concealed spring must, I now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails."
A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring.
"I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash."
“I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively.
"A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught—but the nail could not have been replaced."
"The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations."
The assassins must have escaped through the other window.
"Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture."
"Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the second casement."
"Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor."
I now looked at the nail.
"It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner—driven in nearly up to the head."
"“You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions."
"To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant been lost."
There was no flaw in any link of the chain.
"I had traced the secret to its ultimate result,—and that result was the nail."
"It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew."
"‘There must be something wrong,’ I said, ‘about the nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers."
The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off.
"The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail."
"I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete—the fissure was invisible."
"Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed."
"I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect."
"“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled."
The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed.
"Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail,—farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary."
“The next question is that of the mode of descent.
Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building.
About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.
"From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it."
"I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades—a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux."
"They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis—thus affording an excellent hold for the hands."
In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad.
"When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open—that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall."
"It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration."
"In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination."
"It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod."
"It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.—By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work."
"Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room."
“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat.
"It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished:—but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary—the almost præternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it."
"“You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make out my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter."
"This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason."
My ultimate object is only the truth.
"My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition, that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected.”"
At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my mind.
"I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehend—men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in the end, to remember."
My friend went on with his discourse.
"“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress."
"It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point."
Let us now revert to the interior of the room.
Let us survey the appearances here.
"The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them."
The conclusion here is absurd.
It is a mere guess—a very silly one—and no more.
How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained?
Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life—saw no company—seldom went out—had little use for numerous changes of habiliment.
Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies.
"If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best—why did he not take all?"
"In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen?"
The gold was abandoned.
"Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor."
"I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house."
"Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice."
"Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities—that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration."
"In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence."
It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive.
"But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together."
"“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention—that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this—let us glance at the butchery itself."
"Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward."
Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this.
"Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered."
"In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively outré—something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men."
"Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!"
"“Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous."
On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick tresses—of grey human hair.
These had been torn out by the roots.
You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together.
You saw the locks in question as well as myself.
Their roots (a hideous sight!)
were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp—sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time.
"The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor."
I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds.
Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L’Espanaye I do not speak.
"Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct."
"The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed."
"This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them—because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all."
"“If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification."
"What result, then, has ensued?"
What impression have I made upon your fancy?”
I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question.
"“A madman,” I said, “has done this deed—some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Santé.”"
"“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant."
"But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs."
"Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification."
"Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand."
I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L’Espanaye.
Tell me what you can make of it.”
"“Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual—this is no human hair.”"
"“I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper."
"It is a fac-simile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.’"
"“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold."
There is no slipping apparent.
Each finger has retained—possibly until the death of the victim—the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself.
"Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.”"
I made the attempt in vain.
"“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said."
“The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical.
"Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat."
"Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again.”"
I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before.
"“This,” I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”"
"“Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”"
It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands.
"The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all."
I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.
"“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading, “is in exact accordance with this drawing."
"I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them."
"This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier."
But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery.
"Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.”"
"“True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,—the expression, ‘mon Dieu!’ This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation."
"Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle."
A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder.
It is possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place.
The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him.
"He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it."
It is still at large.
"I will not pursue these guesses—for I have no right to call them more—since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another."
"We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such."
"If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of ‘Le Monde,’ (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence.”"
"He handed me a paper, and I read thus:"
"CAUGHT—In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the—inst., (the morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species."
"The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping."
Call at No.
"——, Rue ——, Faubourg St. Germain—au troisième."
"“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”"
"“I do not know it,” said Dupin."
“I am not sure of it.
"Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond."
"Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese."
I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod.
It could not have belonged to either of the deceased.
"Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement."
"If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire."
"But if I am right, a great point is gained."
"Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement—about demanding the Ourang-Outang."
He will reason thus:—‘I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value—to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger?
"Here it is, within my grasp."
It was found in the Bois de Boulogne—at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery.
How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed?
The police are at fault—they have failed to procure the slightest clew.
"Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance."
"Above all, I am known."
The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast.
I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend.
"Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion."
It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast.
"I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.’”"
At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.
"“Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself.”"
"The front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase."
"Now, however, he seemed to hesitate."
Presently we heard him descending.
"Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up."
"He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber."
"“Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone."
A man entered.
"He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing."
"His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio."
"He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed."
"He bowed awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin."
"“Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin."
“I suppose you have called about the Ourang-Outang.
"Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal."
How old do you suppose him to be?”
"The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:"
“I have no way of telling—but he can’t be more than four or five years old.
Have you got him here?”
"“Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here."
"He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by."
You can get him in the morning.
Of course you are prepared to identify the property?”
"“To be sure I am, sir.”"
"“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin."
"“I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,” said the man."
“Couldn’t expect it.
"Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal—that is to say, any thing in reason.”"
"“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure."
Let me think!—what should I have?
Oh!
I will tell you.
My reward shall be this.
You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue.”
"Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly."
"Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in his pocket."
"He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table."
The sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.
"He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself."
He spoke not a word.
I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.
"“My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself unnecessarily—you are indeed."
We mean you no harm whatever.
"I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury."
I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue.
"It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them."
"From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter—means of which you could never have dreamed."
Now the thing stands thus.
"You have done nothing which you could have avoided—nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable."
"You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity."
You have nothing to conceal.
You have no reason for concealment.
"On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know."
"An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”"
"The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone."
"“So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all I know about this affair;—but I do not expect you to believe one half I say—I would be a fool indeed if I did."
"Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it.”"
"What he stated was, in substance, this."
He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago.
"A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure."
Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang.
"This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession."
"After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship."
His ultimate design was to sell it.
"Returning home from some sailors’ frolic the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined."
"Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet."
"Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do."
"He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted."
"Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street."
"The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it."
It then again made off.
In this manner the chase continued for a long time.
"The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning."
"In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s chamber, in the fourth story of her house."
"Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed."
The whole feat did not occupy a minute.
The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.
"The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed."
"He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down."
"On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house."
This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive.
"A lightning rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room."
At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror.
"Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue."
"Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room."
"It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor."
"The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived."
The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.
"As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L’Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber."
The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned.
The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath.
With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body.
The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy.
"Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired."
"Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible."
"The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear."
"Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead."
"In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong."
"As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home—dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang."
"The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute."
I have scarcely anything to add.
"The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the break of the door."
It must have closed the window as it passed through it.
"It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes."
"Le Don was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police."
"This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business."
"“Let him talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply."
"“Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle."
"Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound."
In his wisdom is no stamen.
"It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,—or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish."
But he is a good creature after all.
"I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity."
"I mean the way he has ‘de nier ce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas.’” (*)"
