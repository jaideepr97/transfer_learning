Not mind it at all. I like my time alone
"I wouldn't care as It is not compulsory that as a friend every time I have to say yes to every thing that they do
Sometimes I have to give preferences to myself"
"If the trek isn't that difficult and exhaustive, then I will go ahead. However, if it is a tedious trek, I would prefer staying back and going back to bed or roam around. "
"It's a no brainer for me, I'll curl up in a blanket and go back to sleep. Then go on the trek alone later in the evening."
"If I'm not eager to go to the trek, then I won't go. I would simply sleep inside my hotel room or wander about the hotel premises."
I won't have any problem as they shouldn't miss out a good opportunity
"I will let them go and follow my everyday routine.  Because,  if I am not eager then I can't enjoy it. "
Sit at home as it is my fault.
"I might reconsider going and if my reason for not going is valid enough I would stay back, not spoil their mood and let them go"
I would make sure I do something that would be more exciting than trek.
I'll try to convince them not to go this early as I can't go trekking alone.
I would go with my friends because it's always fun to be with them
Enjoy some me time 
"As they are my best friends, i would not get angry with them. I will stay in my place and not do the trek."
Stay in
I would always be eager
"Sip a nice hot tea, read a book, listen to some melodious music and click some great pictures of the morning sunrise in the hills"
Enjoy the time I have to myself
Sack out. 
Will spend time alone reading or watching TV.
I would still go with them.
I would try to join them as it is better than staying alone
Enjoy my alone time reading and listening to music
Sleep for some more time 
That's alright. I like being by myself. 
Go with them
Sleep till 11 oâ€™clock and then chill till they come back
I will go back 
I will get up late and catch up with them
