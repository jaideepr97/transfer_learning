"I don't know how to swim in deep waters, but I'd still go"
"Not go as I am afraid of water animals
And I don't know swimming so well"
"Again, if proper arrangements are made, then I would go for it as such opportunities don't  come often. "
I would be delighted and excited for the adventure.
I would go for it after verifying the safety measures that would be taken. My love for dolphins can't surpass the safety of my life!
"I would not go unless proper safety is provided
"
"I would go there,  It will be an exciting experience for me. "
go as it is any exciting experience. I would like to experience underwater  life.
Since I love dolphins I would love to go into the deep pool provided my safety is ensured
I would be hesitant at first but after being assured with the safety I would go.
Go again because it's not a thing which we get to do every now and then.. And one should definitely have such an experience if they get a chance .
I would refuse because I have a fear of water
I would definitely go in
I might go in depending on my mood then
go for it because I love swimming
try it out because I do not have any problems with deep water
Love it
I am afraid of going underwater. So I would not go deep inside.
Go with an expert accompanying you
I would go
Look at the safety precautions and decide to go.
Go because I love dolphins
Jump in
once I.am comfortable ln swimming I'll try.
go!
Not go as I don't know swimming and be worried to take a risk though I love dolphins
Not go because I canâ€™t swim. If it was a shallow pool I would go
I will only watch dolphin show 
Be excited at the prospect of playing with dolphins. 
Yes
Gladly go and have complete adventure
Not go .some things look good from far.
I will because playing with dolphins would be very interesting
