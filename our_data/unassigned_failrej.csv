Get nervous obviously. But still give my best shot as it's a one time opportunity
"Not keep in my mind that the national team selectors are sitting
And play in that mood and spirit how would I play normally"
"Try not to focus on things other than my match, and stay calm. And give my 100% effort in playing the match. "
I would play to the best of my abilities.
"It would be challenging and would put my skills to test, so I would go for it."
I would give my best shot in the game as it can land me a place in the national team
I will perform good as much as possible. Playing against the best team will improve my football skill.
Play as it’s fine anyone’s judging 
I would feel nervous and try to give my best and play just like any other day
I would put extra efforts since I would want to be selected by the selectors.
Since it's good possibility to get selected just by showing how good I can play I'll try to show off some of my good skills without letting them know if that I know whether they are watching me.
I would do my best and not think about anything else
Give it my best
I would try be at my best so that the international selectors would notice me.
Play like I normally do
Play the match and give my best
Put my best foot forward
Play my best to win the match and also to show the national team selectors my potential
Play my best game. 
definitely try.
"play as best as I can, as I always do."
Be very thrilled as it would be great opportunity to get selected for national team
Be excited and motivated because this could be a huge stepping stone
I don’t play football 
Try to do my very best. 
Yes
I would give my best to impress them
Give your best
Try my best to help my team win
